# Most important shell commands for GIT

Here is the output of some code.

```{r chunk 1}
x <- rnorm(100)
summary(x)
```

Here is the output of some code, together with the code that generated it.

```{r chunk 2, echo=TRUE}
x <- rnorm(100)
median(x)
```

We can even mention the result in-line: the median of the simulated data is `r round(median(x), 3)`.

## Formulas

Here is an example of a formula: if $X$ is a continuous random variable, then its **expected value** is
$$
  \mathbb{E}[X] = \int_{-\infty}^\infty x f_X(x)dx,
$$
where $f_X$ is the probability density of $X$. Note that *not every continuous random variable has an expected value*: the integral defining $\mathbb{E}[X]$ does not convergence if $X$ follows a Cauchy distribution.
